				Leverage Herd Behavior
				<br>
				(Put Your Animals to Work)
			</h3>
			<ul id="one">
				<li>
					The bottom line:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Your cash profits are dependent upon energy input
						</li>
						<li>
							Get the most free energy input you can from solar energy, absorbed by dense plant life
						</li>
						<li>
							Use the free labor of herd animals to fertilize your land, stimulate new plant growth, and to turn that plant life into valueable livestock products
						</li>
					</ol>	  
				</li>
				<li>
					No need to spend extra money to increase herd size
				</li>
				<li>
					Manage animals as dense herd, not as individual browsers
				</li>
				<li>
					What will change is the amount of time the herd spends in a given paddock or area
				</li>
				<li>
					The denser herd will be moved frequently once the ground is effectively grazed and impacted
				</li>
				<li>
					Unmanaged individual browsing leads to overresting and overgrazing
				</li>
				<li>
					Overresting and overgrazing lead to decreased profits and drought conditions
				</li>
				<!-- Create glossary page to explain things like overresting and overgrazing -->
				<li>
					Ruminant animals, managed to behave as a herd:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Fertilize your land with urine and manure, saving you money on imported fertilizer inputs
						</li>
						<li>
							Trample down grass litter and biologically decompose plants, returning minerals to the soil to increase grassland productivity
						</li>
						<li>
							Properly graze plants at the right time, cleaning up old plant matter and stimulating new growth
						</li>
						<li>
							Break-up bare and capped soil to allow for new and denser plant growth
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					Increased Plant Density per Square Yard:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Creates more dynamic soil life and root systems that hold more moisture instead of allowing run-off
						</li>
						<li>
							Land stays greener and holds moisture leveraging available rain and irrigation without running up your water bill
						</li>
						<li>
							Enough land that's made to be dense and completely covered can reverse this drought and restore your acquifers.  Yes.

				Plan to Pay Your Business First
				<br>
				(Revenues Are Not Cash Profit)
			</h3>
			<ul id="two">
				<li>
					Recap of how you're making and saving more money:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Energy and Feed:<br>
							Capturing more free energy with dense plant life; your free animal forage
						</li>
						<li>
							Labor:<br>
							Using the free labor of your animal herd to maintain your land
						</li>
						<li>
							Water:<br>
							Your land can now capture more water and will be able to restore acquifers
						</li>
						<li>
							Marketing:<br>
							You're livestock products are now easy to differentiate, commanding higher pricing than commodity markets
						</li>
						<li>
							The primary theme here is expending the least cost inputs to fetch the most profits
							<ol>
								<li>
									A seemingly obvious concept, however, agricultural production tends to miss that mark, mostly to line the pockets of a few major vendors instead of increasing profits for farmers
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					Now: Planning for Profits
					<ol>
						<li>
							Accounting does not account for human nature
						</li>
						<li>
							We tend to increase expenses with increased income
						</li>
						<li>
							Planning business expenses around projected revenue will produce the same results
						</li>
						<li>
							Determine your desired profit margin for financial sustainability and growth
						</li>
						<li>
							That profit margin must be paid to your business
						</li>
						<li>
							Your business expenses are not allowed to reduce profit margin
						</li>
						<li>Think about your business as a vendor.  A vendor that must be paid first before all other vendor and expenses</li>
					</ol>
