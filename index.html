				Increase stocking rate, grazing animals in such a way as to promote even grazing, instead of at-will browsing of favored and therefore overgrazed plant varieties.

				In an environment like the Central Valley, especially during this time of drought, large numbers of ruminant animals are needed to trample down vegetation, break up the soil surface, to fertilize with urine and dung.

				Large number of well-managed ruminant animals are necessary biological composters of plant matter, especially during dry times of the year when soil and environmental microorganism populations are low or dormant.  An important point is that plants must be grazed at the right point in their life cycle.  If they are bitten immediately following their dormancy period while they are still trying to grow from stored energy, they will be delayed in their growth potential for the season.

				When a plant is bitten or defoliated, it shifts energy from the root system to regrow stems and leaves for collecting more energy.  A plant will reduce its roots in order to support stem and leaf.  To a certain extent, a plant will eventually die if it's not allowed enough time to regrow foliage.  This is overgrazing.  Overgrazing, in simplified terms, is grazing of the roots or the expense of the roots.

				In the Central Valley there is no piece of land that should be rested.  Rested land is that which not disturbed by ruminant animals, fertilized, trampled, and composted by thereof.

				Large numbers of ruminante animals are needed to compost plant matter and return it to the soil to be recycled.  If a piece of land is "rested" or not allowed to be effected by ruminant herd behavior, the minerals in the plants, at the end of the plant's life cycle will just oxidize instead of being recycled.  Now this piece of land is in need of costly external fertilizers.

				Herd disturbance of the land is closely related to higher plant density.  The more solor energy that can be caught per square yard of land, the more energy and forage you'll have for your herd.  That solar energy is the basis for your profits.

				Increase stocking rate?  But what about overgrazing? What about over trampling?
				These destructive behaviors are not a matter of animal numbers but of timing and management.  On the contrary, very few ruminant animals left to browse at will can and do cause overgrazing.  High density stocking rate requires more frequent grazing patterns.

				Conventional accounting and busness planning guides the entrepreneur to estimate top-line revenue streams as a basis for business planning.  However, revenue income is not the same as bottom line profits after expenses.  Conventional accounting does not account for our human nature to spend about as much as our income.  A business owner must plan for what percentage of profit she wants the business to take and plan expenses on that profit basis instead of revenue.  Another way of looking at it is that in order for a business to be sustainable, a business must plan to pay itself just as it pays vendors, employees, owners, etc.

				Consumers want "grass-fed", they want "local", country-of-origin labeling, "paleo"-friendly, holistically managed wool, pasture-raised, and so much more.

				Beef prices may continure to be high for the next year or two, however, how is your livestock business going to differentiate itself in the long-run?

				Consumers want to know that they are supporting their regional economy and that they are supporting an honest business that sells highy integrity products.

				Through holistic management you can show how your livestock are acutally contributing to the Central Valley economy, reducing air pollution, sequestering carbon, fostering an effective water cycle to cure our drought.

				You can leverage all of this in your marketing favor to fetch niche marketing pricing for your meat, eggs, fiber, dairy, or any other livestock product.
